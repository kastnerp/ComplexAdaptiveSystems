# ComplexAdaptiveSystems
This is the first assignment for PADM 5449 Fall 2020.

## Instructions

**Challenge #1: Teach the Basics Challenge:** Teaching others is often the best way to learn. Designing documents or media for dissemination to the general public (public understanding) is one of the best ways to gain a deep understanding of course concepts. In this challenge, use any media such as an infographic/poster PDF, a video, or short written 2-3 page primer to develop a short professional quality artifact that helps a newcomer to understand one of the following:

- Evolution of the field of systems thinking; 
- The connections among VUCA & LAMO, the ST Iceberg, ST Loop; 
- The simple rules of Systems Thinking (DSRP) & complex adaptive systems (CAS); or 
- The composition of mental models (M=IxT). 

Be sure to explain things in simple terms and be creative! Your Challenge should be at least as good as the [sample.
