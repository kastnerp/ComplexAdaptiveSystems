				<h2>The common misconception</h2>
				<p>Our mental model about CAS in nature was wrong</p>
			</header>







			<p><span>Many people are enamored by the flocking behavior of animals like fish or birds. However, it is a common misconception that such flocks are led by a leader fish or bird that orchestrate the flock
					(Potts, 1984). In this short interactive lesson, we will discover that no such leader exists.
					Flocks,		herds, or schools, in fact, are the result of emergent behavior that often occurs when the
					individual animals follow simple rules.</span></p>
			<p><span>As the headline suggests, this lesson utilizes the flocking behavior of animals to introduce the
					concept of complex adaptive systems (CAS). Before we begin, let&#39;s lets define what CAS
					are:</span></p>
			<blockquote>
				CAS are
					systems that have a large numbers of components, often called agents, that interact and adapt
					or learn. - <a href='https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/41486/11424_2006_Article_1.pdf;jsessionid=EB2FA2F0D433FA248F6C3B55FD3EE619?sequence=1'>John H. Holland</a>
			</blockquote>


			<p><span>
				Holland posits that although many CAS show differences in the details, they all share four major features: (i) <em>parallelism</em>, (ii) <em>conditional action</em>, (iii) <em>modularity</em>, (iv) <em>adaptation and evolution</em>.</p>				
				<p></p>Put another way, CAS are comprised of many parts (i) whose interactions (ii & iii) lead to complex outcomes (iv) when exercised as a collective.
					Specifically, in CAS, their many parts are usually local agents that follow simple rules concerning their neighbors. 
					This set of simple behaviors followed by a collective may ultimately lead to an emergent outcome.</span></p>

				<h2>CAS in
					Nature</h2>
				<p>How agent-based models can help us simulate emergent behavior</p>
			</header>





			<p><span>It turns out that we are able to simulate such behavior with an approach called agent-based
					modeling
					(ABM). In ABM, a collection of individual agents obeying simple rules is modeled as a system that
					evolves over time. With every timestep, each agent acts upon the rules it obeys constrained by its
					immediate surroundings.</span></p>
			<p><span>In the late 1980s, Craig Reynolds introduced an algorithm that he called the </span><em><span>Boids
						Algorithm</span></em><span> that is based on the ABM approach (Reynolds, 1987). His algorithm
					proposes to model the individuals agents as so-called boids, that possess a certain field of visions
					within which they are able to respond to their surroundings and follow simple rules. Hence, the
					agents&#39; individual perspective is local, they are not aware that they are part of a global
					system,
					neither are they aware of all of their neighbors. </span></p>
			<p><span>When translating the concept of CAS to nature, we can imagine that different CASs have
					individual
					characteristics, depending of whether we think of schools of fish, insects, or flocks of birds.
					Let&#39;s explore a set of possible characteristics in the interactive simulations below.</span></p>

				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<p>The three  rules for the agents to follow are simple</p>
			</header>


The agents or boids in our simulation will start moving from a random location starting from the center of a canvas. While doing that, they will follow three rules with respect to their neighbors in their local vicinity. Their local vicinitry is given by a radius that we call field of vision.

			<h3>Exercise</h3>
			<blockquote>Try to find a combination of rules that will lead to emergent behavior such as what can be
				observed from bird flocking behavior. Once you are happy with your attempt, have a look at a possible solution by clicking the button below.</blockquote>
